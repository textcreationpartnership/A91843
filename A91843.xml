            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:160281:3"/>
and repre≈øenting our de≈øires and demands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that perpetuall blot of infamy, which hath been ca≈øt upon this Armie. by ≈øome wicked per≈øons, who endeavour to involve this Kingdome in a ≈øecond VVarre, and ≈øo overthrow both the priviledges of Parliament and People.</p>
            <p>Sir, We are now upon our march towards your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hourable City, hoping to find redre≈ø≈øe for all our grievances; which if granted (I am con≈øident) it will tend much to the honour of his Maje≈øtie and his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all po≈øteritie, the pre≈øervation of both hou≈øes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the good of the Common weale, and the ≈øafety of the whole Kingdome ingenerall, by rea≈øon whereof, we do conceive the woole Nation to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, (having a long time ≈øuffered under the blood-thir≈øtie and mercile≈ø≈øe ≈øword.) And therefore, for the prevention of a ≈øecond warre, and the ≈øpeedie effecting of a ≈øafe and well-grounded peace, within the Kingdome of England, and Dominion of Wales. It was re≈øolved by the Officers and Souldiers through out the whole Army, at a late Randezvouz, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oweth:
<list>
                  <item>I. That having ≈øome cau≈øe of ≈øu≈øpition, of a new de≈øign, lately contrived by a fal≈øe and ≈øelf-≈øeeking party, for the involving this Kingdome in a new Warre, and to that end are very active, both in the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ≈øeverall other parts of the Kingdom,
<pb facs="tcp:160281:4"/>
to accompli≈øh the ≈øame. It was re≈øolved (with one unanimous con≈øent) by the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ≈øouldiers, under the command of his Excellency Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to demon≈øtrate, and repre≈øent their grievances, and al≈øo to declare the grounds of their intentions, concerning their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and advancing towards the City of <hi>London;</hi> the Army being now upon their march, from their quarters near <hi>Cambridge</hi> toward <hi>Ware,</hi> and ≈øo to proceed on, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion ≈øhall require.</item>
                  <item>II. Their de≈øire is, to pre≈øerve and not to ≈øpoyle, and to that end, are determined both Officers and Souldiers, hor≈øe and foot, not in the lea≈øt, to be accounted the wicked of men, and de≈øtroyers, but pre≈øervers of that remnant and talent which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowed upon tho≈øe, who ≈øerve him in truth and ≈øincerity.</item>
                  <item>III. That although they are now near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching towards your va≈øt and populous City, yet it is no waies prejudiciall to the State, but for the pre≈øervation and ≈øecurity of tho≈øe priviledges, for which divers poor
<pb facs="tcp:160281:4"/>
≈øouldiers have lo≈øt their lives for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the ≈øame.</item>
                  <item>IV. That if there be an an≈øwer returned ≈øomewhat ≈øuitable to their de≈øires, and their rea≈øonable reque≈øts granted, they ≈øhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further, but retreat to any conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place, which ≈øhall be thought fit and convenient.</item>
                  <item>V. That, their de≈øire is, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a faire &amp; ≈øuitable An≈øwer to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øts, (profe≈ø≈øing that their intentions are reall, and not in the lea≈øt, prejudiciall, either to State or Common-Wealth, but for the advantage of the publike good.) And that the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> with whom they have ≈øo often hazarded their lives withall again≈øt the Common Enemy of the Kingdome, may not in any waies ≈øtand in oppo≈øition again≈øt them, but really and unauimou≈øly knit their hearts in one link, again≈øt all oppo≈øers and di≈øturbers of the publike Weale of <hi>England,</hi> in which trouble≈øome di≈øa≈øters, both the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> and the renowned Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices (of the ≈øaid City) in the Army, have w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
